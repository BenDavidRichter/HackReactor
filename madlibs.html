as assistant <span id="adjtwo"></span> in the Swiss patent office and attended

and <span id="femalecele"></span>. He developed the theory of

<span id="malecele"></span> relativity, which expanded the phenomena of sub-atomic

<span id="nounone"></span> and <span id="nountwo"></span> magnetism. In 1921,

theoretical physics at the Kaiser Wilhelm <span id="nounsone"></span> in Berlin.

In 1933, when Hitler became Chancellor of <span id="nounstwo"></span>,

Einstein came to America to take a post at Princeton Institute for

<span id="nounsthree"></span>, where his theories helped America devise the first

atomic <span id="nounsfour"></span>. There is no question about it: Einstein was

one of the most brilliant <span id="ppro"></span> of our time.
